Week 1 - Introduction, Open Science, and Power

When you are in your breakout rooms/groups, your task is to:
Come up with a name for your group.
Add the name of your group below in the Google doc.
Think about and discuss the following 4 questions in your groups. After discussion, under your group name write down your thoughts/answers in this Google doc. The questions are:

How much did you know about the replication crisis and the importance of reproducibility in research before going through the Workshop 1 material?
What do you think is the most important ‘take home’ message from the replication crisis?
How has your own research area tackled the issue of reproducibility and replication?
Have you used R before?

Week 2 - Introduction to R

Did you have any problems installing R and RStudio on your computers?  If you did, what were they and how did you solve them?

Did you have any problems getting the “Your First R Script” script to run?  If you did, what were they?  Did you manage to solve them?  If so, how?

Let’s change some of the bits of our script and see what happens. After each change, run the code and note down what changes.

In the plot1 code, put a hash symbol # at the start of the line ‘coord_flip()’  - this will turn the line into a comment and it won’t be executed. Run the code again - what changes?
In the plot1 code, put a hash symbol # at the start of the line `theme_minimal()`- this will turn the line into a comment and it won’t be executed. Run the code again - what changes?
In the plot2 code, change the size and alpha values for the line `geom_point(size = .5, alpha = .25)`. Run the code again - what changes? Change to some other values and see what happens.
In the plot3 code, change the size value in the line `theme(text = element_text(size = 15))`. Run the code again - what changes? Change to some other values and see what happens.
In the plot3 code, change geom_col() to geom_point() - what changes? 


Week 3 - Data Wrangling and Summarising Your Data

In your groups, work through the Your Challenge section at the bottom of the Summarising Your Data section. Continue 
wrangling and summarising the Star Wars dataset. Add below some interesting descriptive statistical facts about what you’ve discovered in 
that dataset and paste the code you used to uncover those facts...

Week 4 - Data Visualisation

Section A (Complete before the live class please) Did you encounter any major or minor problems while working through the data 
visualisation content? If so, can you list them below (and add your name please).

Section B (Complete in class) In your groups, create some new visualisations using the mpg or NHANES or any 
other dataset you want. One person in each group should share their screen with the others in their breakout 
room - that person then types in and runs the code that you create in your group collaboratively. Paste your 
creations into this Google doc under your group name. After the breakout rooms close, we’ll all return to the 
main room and in the main room (if we have time) I would like each group to share with everyone else their best 
visualisation - and their worst!

Week 5 - R Markdown

Convert to R Markdown some of the R scripts you've created previously. 
Add headers, hide output that's not needed etc.

Week 6 - GLM - Regression Part 1

Complete the Your Challenge section at the bottom of the Regression 1 workshop.

Week 7 - GLM - Regressoin Part 2

This challenge involves using the ‘Coffee Ratings’ dataset from Tidy Tuesday on July 7th 2020. This readme contains information about the
dataset and a data dictionary.

You can download the data with:

coffee_ratings <-
read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv')

Your task is to construct a regression model that best predicts coffee flavour using all or some of the following predictors: aroma, 
aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, sweetness, uniformity, clean_cup, and moisture.

Week 8

Reading Week

Week 9 - GLM - ANOVA Part 1

Complete the You Challenge section of ANOVA part 1.

Week 10 - GLM - ANOVA Part 2

For those of you who didn’t get to finish the ‘Your Challenge’ section from the first ANOVA workshop, please do make sure you get that 
done today - I want to ensure everyone leaves today’s session with practice in building ANOVA models for different designs.  The previous 
workshop challenges can be found at the end here:

https://ajstewartlang.github.io/11_glm_anova_pt1/knitted_workshop/11_glm_anova_pt1.html

If you have completed the ‘Your Challenge’ section from the previous workshop, then what I’d like you to do today is build *regression* 
models for the first 2 data sets that are the equivalent to the ANOVA models that you built previously. The asynchronous material for 
today’s session focused a fair bit on demonstrating how you do that. This will (hopefully!) convince you that ANOVA and regression are 
really just the same thing - and both are based on the General Linear Model.

Week 11 - Binder

I would like you to Binderise one of your R Scripts.
